# Neural Machine Translation

This is my attempt to create a simple **NMT** for converting *ENGLISH* language to *HINDI*.
I have used **skip-gram model** to create the word embeddings and used **Tensorflow's *seq2seq* model** for building the **encoder-decoder** network.

## DATASET
The dataset was downloaded from [Hindi - English](http://www.manythings.org/anki/)
